VanDieren has over 13 years of project management experience leading research and educational projects in mathematical logic, learning science, and educational technology. She is a highly cited, interdisciplinary author managing grant-funded, multi-university research projects including collaboration on the [CalcPlot3D](https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html) project. Strategically, she quadrupled the enrollment of an award-winning honors program while increasing the academic profile of the students. She regularly collaborates across organizational boundaries and with representatives from external grant agencies, partner universities, and community nonprofits. Her proven track record of integrating evidence-based teaching practices and technology into the classroom has been recognized internatinoally, and she holds leadership positions in national and regional organizations. 

Model Theory Research
---
VanDieren's mathematics research is in Model Theory, a branch of Mathematical Logic.  Her specialization is in [abstract elementary classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_elementary_class).  In her Ph.D. thesis she introduced the concept of [tameness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tame_abstract_elementary_class) for abstract elementary classes and began the development of a classification theory for these classes.  A 2006 American Institute of Mathematics workshop was dedicated to advancing this work.  An invited editorial of her experience co-organizing that workshop appeared in the [AIM newsletter](https://aimath.org/wp-content/uploads/newsletter2006.pdf).

Two of VanDieren's papers have been consistently ranked among the top 20 most-cited articles of the [Journal of Mathematical Logic](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/jml).  Her papers, "Categoricity from one successor cardinal in tame abstract elementary classes" and "Galois-stability of tame abstract elementary classes," have appeared at number 1 and number 2, respectively, on the JML list of most-cited papers as recently as January 2018.  Ten of her papers have been cited over 20 times each and five over 50 times each.  Overall her work has been cited over 500 times according to Google Scholar.
